# Revature Big Data - Project 1

### Enabling Hive features with querying and optimizations where the main focal point is to understand the organization and positioning of data. Followed by querying the data, loading it into HDFS , and querying it into Hive. All of these processes are accomplished on Ubuntu.


* Loaded data files into Hive Warehouse in HDFS
* Defined tables for dataset files
* Defined composite tables using Joins
* Designed Hive queries to answer the given questions about the data
* Utilized various Hive SQL operators and functions such as INTERSECT, GROUP BY,  and ROW_NUMBER() to successfully answer the questions
* Utilized partitons, indexes, and views to optimize performance
* Explored table properties metadata to aid other developers in understanding the tables
* Created and presented a slideshow showing my queries and their results
